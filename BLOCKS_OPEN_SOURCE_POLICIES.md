<a href="https://square.com/"><img src="profile/banner.png"></a>

**Open Source Trademark Policy**

Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) open source projects may include trademarks and logos, such as project names (OSS Trademarks). If you’d like to use Block OSS Trademarks outside the scope of this policy, please email us at [trademarks@squareup.com](mailto:trademarks@squareup.com).

**Nominative Fair Use Allowed**

You may use our open source project names for discussion, commentary, and criticism, so long as your use does not suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation between you or any third-party and Block. You may not use our open source logos without permission.

**Unauthorized Use**

You may not use Block OSS Trademarks in a manner inconsistent with this policy without written permission. Please do not use Block OSS Trademarks as open source project names, domain names, usernames, mobile app names, or company names. As an example, you may not use Block OSS Trademarks (or any of Block’s non-OSS trademarks) in the name of a forked software project.
